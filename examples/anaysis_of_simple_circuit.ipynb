    "# Initialising The Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea for PSO is that we set a swarm $\\mathbf{S}$ composed of particles $\\mathbf{P}_n$ into a search space in order to find the optimal solution. The movement of the swarm depends on the cognitive ($c_1$) and social ($c_2$) of all the particles. The cognitive component speaks of the particle's bias towards its personal best from its past experience (i.e., how attracted it is to its own best position). The social component controls how the particles are attracted to the best score found by the swarm (i.e., the global best). High $c_1$ paired with low $c_2$ values can often cause the swarm to stagnate. The inverse can cause the swarm to converge too fast, resulting in suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our particle $\\mathbf{P}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P}\\,:=\\,\\mathbf{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the swarm as being composed of $N$ particles with certain positions at a timestep $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{S}_t\\,:=\\,[\\,\\mathbf{P}_1\\quad\\mathbf{P}_2\\quad ... \\quad\\mathbf{P}_N\\,]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we designate $\\mathbf{P}_1$ as the initial configuration of the manipulator at the zero-position. This means that the angles are equal to 0 and the link offset is also zero. We then generate the $N-1$ particles using a uniform distribution which is controlled by the hyperparameter $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding The Global Optimum\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the global optimum, the swarm must be moved. This movement is then translated by an update of the current position given the swarm's velocity $\\mathbf{V}$. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{S}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{S}_t + \\mathbf{V}_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity is then computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{V}_{t+1} = w\\mathbf{V}_t + c_1 r_1 (\\mathbf{p}_{best} - \\mathbf{p}) + c_2 r_2(\\mathbf{g}_{best} - \\mathbf{p})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r_1$ and $r_2$ denote random values in the intervall $[0,1]$, $\\mathbf{p}_{best}$ is the best and $\\mathbf{p}$ is the current personal position and $\\mathbf{g}_{best}$ is the best position of all the particles. Moreover, $w$ is the inertia weight that controls the \"memory\" of the swarm's previous position.\n",
