    "# Feature Subset Selection\n",

    "## A short primer on feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for feature subset selection is to be able to find the best features that are suitable to the classification task. We must understand that not all features are created equal, and some may be more relevant than others. Thus, if we're given an array of features, how can we know the most optimal subset? (yup, this is a rhetorical question!)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Binary PSO, the position of the particles are expressed in two terms: `1` or `0` (or on and off). If we have a particle $x$ on $d$-dimensions, then its position can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_d] ~~~\\text{where}~~~ x_i \\in {0,1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the position of the particle for each dimension can be seen as a simple matter of on and off. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature selection and the objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we're given a dataset with $d$ features. What we'll do is that we're going to _assign each feature as a dimension of a particle_. Hence, once we've implemented Binary PSO and obtained the best position, we can then interpret the\n",
    "binary array (as seen in the equation above) simply as turning a feature on and off. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we have a dataset with 5 features, and the final best position of the PSO is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> optimizer.best_pos\n",
    "np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0])\n",
    ">>> optimizer.best_cost\n",
    "0.00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this means that the second, third, and fourth (or first, second, and third in zero-index) that are turned on are the selected features for the dataset. We can then train our classifier using only these features while dropping the others. How do we then define our objective function? (Yes, another rhetorical question!). We can design our own, but for now I'll be taking an equation from the works of [Vieira, Mendoca, Sousa, et al. (2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494613001361).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(X) = \\alpha(1-P) + (1-\\alpha) \\left(1 - \\dfrac{N_f}{N_t}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that decides the tradeoff between the classifier performance $P$, and the size of the feature subset $N_f$ with respect to the total number of features $N_t$. The classifier performance can be the accuracy, F-score, precision, and so on."
