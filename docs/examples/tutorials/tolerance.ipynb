    "In this example we will have a look at the various early stopping features available. These features are based on \"tolerance\" values when finding an optimum solution for the objective function. The optimizers have two parameters namely `ftol` and `ftol_iter` that work together to provide this additional functionality.\n",

    "`ftol` is defined as the relative error in the objective function that is acceptable for convergence. In simpler terms, `ftol` stops the optimizer if absolute difference between the `current_best_cost` and the `best_cost_yet_found` is less than the relative measure defined as \n",

    "### ftol_iter\n",
    "`ftol_iter` helps to generatilze the `ftol` property and extends the feature over 'n' iterations. As a fixed tolerance might seem too restrictive, `ftol_iter` provides the optimizer some breathing space to improve the best cost. If there are no improvements detected over ftol_iter subsequent iterations, the optimizer stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: To maintain the initial functionality of `ftol` (stop immediately), default value of `ftol_iter = 1`. The default value of `ftol = -inf` to completey disable early stopping."

    "## Knapsack problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.
