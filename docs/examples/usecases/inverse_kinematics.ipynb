    "# Inverse Kinematics Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are going to use the `pyswarms` library to solve a 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem by treating it as an optimization problem. We will use the `pyswarms` library to find an *optimal* solution from a set of candidate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Kinematics is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. The problem involves finding an optimal *pose* for a manipulator given the position of the end-tip effector as opposed to forward kinematics, where the end-tip position is sought given the pose or joint configuration. Normally, this position is expressed as a point in a coordinate system (e.g., in a Cartesian system with $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates). However, the pose of the manipulator can also be expressed as the collection of joint variables that describe the angle of bending or twist (in revolute joints) or length of extension (in prismatic joints).\n",
    "\n",
    "IK is particularly difficult because an abundance of solutions can arise. Intuitively, one can imagine that a robotic arm can have multiple ways of reaching through a certain point. It's the same when you touch the table and move your arm without moving the point you're touching the table at. Moreover, the calculation of these positions can be very difficult. Simple solutions can be found for 3-DOF manipulators but trying to solve the problem for 6 or even more DOF can lead to challenging algebraic problems."

    "In this implementation, we are going to use a *6-DOF Stanford Manipulator* with 5 revolute joints and 1 prismatic joint. Furthermore, the constraints of the joints are going to be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameters | Lower Boundary | Upper Boundary |\n",
    "|:---:|:----------------:|:----------------:|\n",
    "|$\\theta_1$  | $-\\pi$         | $\\pi$          |\n",
    "|$\\theta_2$  |$-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$| $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$|\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, if we are given an *end-tip position* (in this case a $xyz$ coordinate) we need to find the optimal parameters with the constraints imposed in **Table 1**. These conditions are then sufficient in order to treat this problem as an optimization problem. We define our parameter vector $\\mathbf{X}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X}\\,:=\\, [ \\, \\theta_1 \\quad \\theta_2 \\quad d_3\\ \\quad \\theta_4 \\quad \\theta_5 \\, ]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We can then start implementing our optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing the Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea for PSO is that we set a swarm $\\mathbf{S}$ composed of particles $\\mathbf{P}_n$ into a search space in order to find the optimal solution. The movement of the swarm depends on the cognitive ($c_1$) and social ($c_2$) of all the particles. The cognitive component speaks of the particle's bias towards its personal best from its past experience (i.e., how attracted it is to its own best position). The social component controls how the particles are attracted to the best score found by the swarm (i.e., the global best). High $c_1$ paired with low $c_2$ values can often cause the swarm to stagnate. The inverse can cause the swarm to converge too fast, resulting in suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our particle $\\mathbf{P}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P}\\,:=\\,\\mathbf{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the swarm as being composed of $N$ particles with certain positions at a timestep $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{S}_t\\,:=\\,[\\,\\mathbf{P}_1\\quad\\mathbf{P}_2\\quad ... \\quad\\mathbf{P}_N\\,]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we designate $\\mathbf{P}_1$ as the initial configuration of the manipulator at the zero-position. This means that the angles are equal to 0 and the link offset is also zero. We then generate the $N-1$ particles using a uniform distribution which is controlled by the hyperparameter $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the global optimum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the global optimum, the swarm must be moved. This movement is then translated by an update of the current position given the swarm's velocity $\\mathbf{V}$. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{S}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{S}_t + \\mathbf{V}_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity is then computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{V}_{t+1} = w\\mathbf{V}_t + c_1 r_1 (\\mathbf{p}_{best} - \\mathbf{p}) + c_2 r_2(\\mathbf{g}_{best} - \\mathbf{p})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r_1$ and $r_2$ denote random values in the intervall $[0,1]$, $\\mathbf{p}_{best}$ is the best and $\\mathbf{p}$ is the current personal position and $\\mathbf{g}_{best}$ is the best position of all the particles. Moreover, $w$ is the inertia weight that controls the \"memory\" of the swarm's previous position."
