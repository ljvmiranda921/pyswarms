1.0.0 (2019-02-08)
------------------

This is the first major release of PySwarms. Starting today, we will be adhering to a `better semantic versioning guidelines`_. We will be updating the project wikis shortly after. The maintainers believe that PySwarms is mature enough to merit a version 1, this would also help us release more often (mostly minor releases) and create patch releases as soon as possible.

Also, we will be maintaining a quarterly release cycle, where the **next minor release (v.1.0.0) will be on June**. All enhancements and new features will be staged on the :code:`development` branch, then will be merged back to the :code:`master` branch at the end of the cycle. However, bug fixes and documentation errors will merit a patch release, and will be merged to :code:`master` immediately.

* **NEW:** Boundary and velocity handlers to resolve stuck particles - `#238`_ . All thanks for our maintainer, `@whzup`_ !
* **FIX:** Duplication function calls during optimization, hopefully your long-running objective functions won't take doubly long. - `#266`_. Thank you `@danielcorreia96`_ !

2.0.0 (2020-10-02)
------------------

Complete overhaul of the codebase

- Update to python 3.10
- Replace setup.py with pyproject.toml
- Add type annotations everywhere
- Refactor optimizers, extract main loop logic into multiple functions in single base class
- Replace attrs lib with dataclasses
- Refactor handlers into separate classes with factories
- Re-implement boundaray handlers to be more efficient
- Make boundaries support scalar values
- Create VelocityUpdater class with full responsibility for particle velocities
- Create PositionUpdater class with full responsibility for particle positions
- Use poetry for dependency management
- Use loguru for logging
- Considerably speed up the tests
- Make GridSearch and RandomSearch more flexible by allowing for multiple topologies in a search

Bugs fixed:
- Fix incorrect dynamic warning in topology class
