0.1.0 (2017-07-12)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
* Includes primary optimization techniques such as global-best PSO and local-best PSO - `#1`_, `#3`_

.. _#3: https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarmsissues/3

0.1.1 (2017-07-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Patch on LocalBestPSO implementation. It seems that it's not returning the best value of the neighbors, this fixes the problem .
* **New feature:** Test functions for single-objective problems - `#6`_, `#10`_, `#14`_. Contributed by `@Carl-K <https://github.com/Carl-K>`_. Thank you!
