r"""
A Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (binary PSO) algorithm.

It takes a set of candidate solutions, and tries to find the best
solution using a position-velocity update method. Unlike
:mod:`pyswarms.single.gb` and :mod:`pyswarms.single.lb`, this technique
is often applied to discrete binary problems such as job-shop scheduling,
sequencing, and the like.

The update rule for the velocity is still similar, as shown in the
proceeding equation:

.. math::

   v_{ij}(t + 1) = w * v_{ij}(t) + c_{1}r_{1j}(t)[y_{ij}(t) − x_{ij}(t)] + c_{2}r_{2j}(t)[\hat{y}_{j}(t) − x_{ij}(t)]

For the velocity update rule, a particle compares its current position
with respect to its neighbours. The nearest neighbours are being
determined by a kD-tree given a distance metric, similar to local-best
PSO. The neighbours are computed for every iteration. However, this whole
behavior can be modified into a global-best PSO by changing the nearest
neighbours equal to the number of particles in the swarm. In this case,
all particles see each other, and thus a global best particle can be established.

In addition, one notable change for binary PSO is that the position
update rule is now decided upon by the following case expression:

.. math::

    X_{ij}(t+1) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        0, & \text{if } \text{rand() } \geq S(v_{ij}(t+1))\\
        1, & \text{if } \text{rand() } < S(v_{ij}(t+1))
        \end{array}\right\}

Where the function :math:`S(x)` is the sigmoid function defined as:

.. math::

    S(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}

This enables the algorithm to output binary positions rather than
a stream of continuous values as seen in global-best or local-best PSO.

This algorithm was adapted from the standard Binary PSO work of J. Kennedy and
R.C. Eberhart in Particle Swarm Optimization [SMC1997]_.
